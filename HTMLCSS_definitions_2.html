	<h2>Here are some terms to know for css.</h2>

	<p>A <b>rule</b> would be considered: <b>p {…}</b> </p>

	<p>The <b>selector</b> in this case is: <b>p</b></p>

	<p>A <b>rule</b> is made up of <b>selectors</b> and <b>declarations.</b></p>

	<p> A <b>declaration</b> is: <b>{property:value}</b></p> 

	<p>The <b>entire rule</b> would be: selector <b>{ property:value }</b></p>

	<p><b><o>A rule can have multiple declarations and multiple selectors</o></b> so we can actually have:
	<b>selector, selector2 { property:value; property2:value; }</b> </p>
	
	<p>A rule set would be multiple rules.</p>


	<h2>Further HTML definitions.</h2>

	<p>Style can be a tag and an attribute. The style tag would go into the head tag.</p>
